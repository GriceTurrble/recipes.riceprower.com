We've tried a few different recipes for pancakes in the past, but this one (from America's Test Kitchen) makes some of the tastiest we've ever had. Combined with the homemade brown sugar butter syrup (which can easily be made at the same time), these pancakes are nearly on par with a dessert yellow cake with caramel icing; but for breakfast, brunch, or a brekkie-for-dinner night!

We recommend starting the syrup around the same time you drop the first pancakes into the skillet, as it's mostly hands-off. You'll just need to keep an eye on its heat, keep a timer on it, and let it rest off the heat before being served.

## Ingredients

### for Pancakes
<div class="recipe-ingredients" markdown>

- [ ] 2 cups (10 oz) all-purpose flour
- [ ] 3 tbsp sugar
- [ ] 4 tsp baking powder
- [ ] 1/2 tsp baking soda
- [ ] 1 tsp table salt
- [ ] 2 large eggs
- [ ] 1/4 cup (plus 1 tsp) vegetable oil, divided
- [ ] 1 1/2 cup milk
- [ ] 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- [ ] butter (for melting in pan, 1 tbsp at a time as needed)

</div>

### for Syrup
<div class="recipe-ingredients" markdown>

- [ ] 2 cups brown sugar
- [ ] 1 cup water
- [ ] 1/2 cup butter
- [ ] *optional* 1/4 tsp vanilla or maple extract

</div>

## Directions
### for Pancakes
<div class="recipe-directions" markdown>

1. Whisk **flour**, **sugar**, **baking powder**, **baking soda**, and **salt** together in a large bowl
2. In a second, medium bowl, whisk **eggs** and **1/4 cup oil** until well combined. Whisk **milk** and **vanilla** into the egg mixture.
3. Add egg mixture to the flour mixture and stir gently until just combined (batter should remain lumpy with few streaks of flour).
4. Let batter sit for 10 minutes before cooking.
5. Heat 1/2 tsp oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat until shimmering. Using paper towels, carefully wipe out oil, leaving thin film on the bottom and sides of skillet. Drop 1 tbsp butter in center of skillet.[^1]

    !!! tip
        You may want to preheat the oven to 200°F starting now to keep pancakes warm before serving.

        You also may want to start the **Syrup** recipe (see below) after the first pancakes hit the skillet, if you want to serve them together.

6. Using 1/4-cup dry measuring cup, portion batter into skillet in 3 places, leaving 2 inches between portions. If necessary, gently spread batter into 4-inch round. Cook until edges are set, first sides are golden brown, and bubble on surface are just beginning to break, 2 to 3 minutes.
7. Using thin, wide spatula, flip pancakes and continue to cook until second sides are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Serve immediately, or keep pancakes warm in 200°F oven until ready to serve.

[^1]: If pancake is pale golden brown after 1 minute, skillet is ready. If it is too light or dark, adjust heat accordingly.

### for Syrup
<div class="recipe-directions" markdown>

1. Combine the sugar and water in a medium-sized saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring until the sugar has dissolved. Lower the heat to medium and allow the mixture to boil for 4 minutes.
2. Add the butter and stir until the butter has dissolved. Remove from the heat and add the extract if desired.
3. Let the syrup cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a pitcher or jar for storage. Serve immediately or store tightly covered in the refrigerator for up to a month.[^2]

[^2]: After the syrup is stored in the fridge, most of the fat from the butter will separate and float to the top. You can either microwave the sauce for 30-60 seconds to recombine them, or discard that fat entirely.
