prep_time: 15
cook_time: 30
servings: 8
ingredients:
  - 1 lb ground beef
  - 1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
  - 1 egg
  - garlic powder to taste
  - 1 dash Worcestershire sauce
  - 1/3 cup ketchup
  - 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
  - 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
directions:
  - |
    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
  - |
    In a large bowl, combine ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, garlic powder, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix well by hand, then place into a 9x13-inch baking dish and form into a loaf shape.
  - |
    Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes.
  - |
    **Meanwhile**, in a separate medium bowl, stir together ketchup, brown sugar, and apple cider vinegar.
  - |
    Pour sauce mixture on top of meatloaf, then bake an additional 15 minutes or until a thermometer reads 160 degrees F (~72 degrees C) at the center of the loaf.
  - |
    Remove from oven and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Cut into slices and serve.
footnotes:

    The original form of this recipe calls for *1/4 cup pineapple preserves* instead of the apple cider vinegar, but that seemed wrong on a number of levels. The recipe above does the job just fine, thank you.

    If somehow you end up with leftovers, try it this way: chill in the fridge overnight, slice thinly while it's cold, and fry in a bit of olive oil or butter. This makes for a great workday lunch by itself, with sides, or on a sandwich.

It's the perfect mid-week meal for the family. Simply, quick, and everyone loves it. Pair with the classic mashed potatoes and a hearty veg like green beans (buttered with a touch of lemon juice?).
