Check out the [Red Wine Pot Roast](../../../../recipes/red_wine_pot_roast.md) recipe just added! It's a family favorite we've been making every couple weeks for the past year, and it's always a hit.

There have also been some updates to the site structure since the last post (yesterday's), which should clean things up considerably. No more useless indexes where they don't belong!

I do have to write these kinds of updates manually instead of them just being displayed in the front page, but of course I'll never pass up an opportunity to just keep writing things (especially after a good meal).

Anyway, it's cold out there, but this recipe warmed our table for the past few nights, and I hope it does the same for yours. :slight_smile:
