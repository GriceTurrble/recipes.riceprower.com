    If you know someone from Buffalo, they know someone who told them the secret ingredients to the Anchor Bar's famous Buffalo chicken wings. I know people from Buffalo. This is my version of Buffalo sauce, as described to me many years ago, over almost as many beers.

## Ingredients
<div class="recipe-ingredients" markdown>

- [ ] 2/3 cup hot pepper sauce (Frank's RedHot)
- [ ] 1/2 cup cold unsalted butter
- [ ] 1 1/2 tbsp white vinegar
- [ ] 1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- [ ] 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
- [ ] 1/8 tsp garlic powder
- [ ] salt to taste

## Directions

1. Combine hot sauce, butter, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, cayenne, garlic powder, and salt in a pot over medium heat. Bring to a simmer while stirring with a whisk. As soon as the liquid begins to bubble on the sides of the pot, remove from heat, stir with the whisk, and set aside for use.
