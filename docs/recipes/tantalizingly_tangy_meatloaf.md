The perfect mid-week meal for the family. Simply, quick, and everyone loves it. Pair with the classic mashed potatoes and a hearty veg like green beans (buttered with a touch of lemon juice?).

## Ingredients
<div class="recipe-ingredients" markdown>

- [ ] 1 lb ground beef
- [ ] 1/2 cup dry bread crumbs
- [ ] 1 egg
- [ ] garlic powder to taste
- [ ] 1 dash Worcestershire sauce
- [ ] 1/3 cup ketchup
- [ ] 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
- [ ] 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar [^1]

[^1]: The original form of this recipe calls for *1/4 cup pineapple preserves* instead of the apple cider vinegar, but that seemed wrong on a number of levels. The recipe above does the job just fine, thank you.

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. In a large bowl, combine ground beef, bread crumbs, egg, garlic powder, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix well by hand, then place into a 9x13-inch baking dish and form into a loaf shape.

    !!! warning "Keep going!"
        Move on to the next step immediately! Yes I've made this mistake before!

4. In a separate medium bowl, stir together ketchup, brown sugar, and apple cider vinegar.

    !!! ingredients
        **Using:** 1/3 cup ketchup; 1/4 cup dark brown sugar; 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar

5. Pour sauce mixture on top of meatloaf, then bake an additional 15 minutes or until a thermometer reads 160 degrees F (~72 degrees C) at the center of the loaf.
6. Remove from oven and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Cut into slices and serve.

## Notes

- If somehow you end up with leftovers, try it this way: chill in the fridge overnight, slice thinly while it's cold, and fry in a bit of olive oil or butter. This makes for a great workday lunch by itself, with sides, or on a sandwich.
