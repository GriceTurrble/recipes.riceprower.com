  - Rack of pork ribs
  - 1/2 cup brown sugar
  - 1/4 cup paprika
  - 1 tbsp black pepper
  - 1 tbsp salt
  - 1 tbsp chili powder
  - 1 tbsp garlic powder
  - 1 tbsp onion powder
  - 1 tsp ground cayenne pepper

  - |
    Preheat oven to 225Â°F.
  - |
    Combine all spice ingredients in a bowl. Mix well.
  - |
    Pat rib meat dry with a paper towel.
  - |
    Generously sprinkle spice mix onto ribs. Don't be afraid to go overboard: you can just dump the mix on, the tap the ribs to let any excess fall off back into the bowl.

    Place ribs, meat facing up, on a baking tray, then bake for 3-1/2 to 4 hours.
