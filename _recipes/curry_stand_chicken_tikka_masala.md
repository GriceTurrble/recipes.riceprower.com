ingredients:
  - 2 tbsp ghee (clarified butter)
  - 1 onion, finely chopped
  - 4 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 tbsp ground cumin
  - 1 tsp salt, or more to taste (Optional)
  - 1 tsp ground ginger
  - 1 tsp cayenne pepper
  - 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
  - 1/4 tsp ground turmeric
  - 1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce
  - 1 cup heavy whipping cream
  - 1 tbsp white sugar, or more to taste (Optional)
  - 2 tsp paprika
  - 1 tbsp vegetable oil
  - 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into bite-size pieces
  - 1/2 tsp curry powder
directions:
  - |
    Heat ghee in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook and stir just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir cumin, 1 teaspoon salt, ginger, cayenne pepper, cinnamon, and turmeric into onion mixture; fry until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
  - |
    Stir tomato sauce into onion and spice mixture; bring to a boil and reduce heat to low. Simmer sauce for 10 minutes, then mix in cream, 1 tablespoon sugar, and paprika. Bring sauce back to a simmer and cook, stirring often, until sauce is thickened, 10 to 15 minutes.

    Heat vegetable oil in a separate skillet over medium heat. Stir chicken into hot oil; add curry powder. Sear chicken until lightly browned but still pink inside, about 3 minutes; stir often.
  - |
    Transfer chicken and any pan juices into sauce. Simmer chicken in sauce until no longer pink, about 30 minutes; adjust sugar and salt to taste.

From [AllRecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/228293/curry-stand-chicken-tikka-masala-sauce/):

> A tikka masala sauce from a classic curry-stand recipe. This is not haute cuisine; it's the kind of nuclear-orange tikka masala you crave when you stumble out of a pub at 2 a.m. I make vast quantities of this sauce at one time as it freezes well. I also use more cayenne pepper than 1 teaspoon, but I give out the recipe like this for people who don't like heat.
