<!--
    Template
    All the above keys in the template are required in a new recipe.

    Content below will be displayed as-is.

    The wrapping divs for `ingredients`, `directions`, and `footnotes` supply custom styling to their contents.

    To generate an image for the recipe, save a `.png` with the same name as THIS FILE
    (file "great_thing.md" -> "great_thing.png"),
    then drop that file in the docs/img directory. The image sourcing will happen automatically.
