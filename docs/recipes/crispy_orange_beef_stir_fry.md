## Directions
<div class="recipe-directions" markdown>

1. In a small bowl, combine the orange juice, zest, sugar, soy sauce, garlic, ginger and rice vinegar. Leave aside for later.
2. Pat beef strips dry with paper towel. In a medium medium bowl, mix the cornflour with the salt and pepper and toss the beef in the cornstarch until completely coated.
3. In a wok or large frying pan, heat the oils over medium-high heat. When it's hot, tip the beef in and fry until crispy. Leave the meat resting in the pan to cook and brown, without mixing too often (or it will boil and turn gray, instead), about 9 minutes. Remove the beef using a slotted spoon, and place in a bowl lined with paper towels to soak up excess fat. Leave remaining oil in the pan.
4. Turn the heat down to medium, then add red pepper and onion to the pan. Fry for a 1 to 2 minutes, leaving them hot but still crunchy. Add the orange sauce, turn heat up to medium-high, and bring to the boil.
5. Add the beef back to the pan. Stir and heat through for 1 minute. If your sauce is looking too thin, mix some cornstarch with cold water in a small bowl then stir into the pan to thicken the sauce.
6.  Serve over rice[^2]. Garnish with the green onions.

[^1]: For a tangier citrus flavor, you can instead use mandarin or clementine oranges. Use the juice of 4 or 5 mandarins, and the zest of 2.
[^2]: Consider frying the rice, too! First prepare normally rice, then allow to cool. Add to a clean skillet over medium heat and heat through for 1-2 minutes, allowing some moisture to evaporate. You can also push rice to the side of the pan and scramble some eggs, then mix them together for a heart fried rice dish.
